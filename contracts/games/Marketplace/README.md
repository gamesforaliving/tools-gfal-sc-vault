# GFAL Marketplace Smart contract

The GFAL Marketplace is a decentralized platform for buying and selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using the GFAL token as a medium of exchange. The marketplace supports both ERC721 and ERC1155 token standards.

## Features

The GFAL Marketplace offers the following features:

- **Sell NFTs:** users can sell their NFTs by setting a price and amount for each token.
- **Buy NFTs:** users can purchase NFTs listed on the marketplace.
- **Update Sale Price:** users can update the Sale price while selling.
- **Whitelist:** only NFTs from whitelisted collections can be sold on the marketplace.
- **ERC721 and ERC1155 support:** the marketplace supports both token standards.
- **Royalties:** a percentage of the sales goes to the protocol as royalties.
- **Maintenance mode:** the marketplace can be temporarily disabled for maintenance, but it will allow the sellers to update and remove tokens from sale.
