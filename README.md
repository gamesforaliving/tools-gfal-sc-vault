# Games for a Living (GFAL) Web3 Contract Bundle

Welcome to the Games for a Living (GFAL) Web3 Contract repository! This repository contains all the Solidity smart contracts implemented in the GFAL ecosystem. Our goal is to create a decentralized gaming platform that provides an engaging and rewarding experience for players, developers, and content creators alike.

## Overview

The GFAL ecosystem is built upon a suite of smart contracts that facilitate the creation, management, and exchange of gaming assets and resources. These contracts handle various aspects of the ecosystem, such as token management, marketplace transactions, and platform governance.

Our smart contracts are designed to be secure, efficient, and interoperable, ensuring seamless integration with other components of the GFAL ecosystem and the wider Ethereum network.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

/contracts: Contains the core Solidity smart contracts for the GFAL ecosystem.
/test: Contains unit tests for the smart contracts.
